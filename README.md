This is a demo Notepad type application I tried to develop while I was learning [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html). It has options like New File, Open File, Save File and Exit. Other options include Cut, Copy, Paste. Original concept by Mrinal Verma for [GeeksForGeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/make-notepad-using-tkinter/), modified by me, [Sayantan Chaudhuri](https://twitter.com/AgileArchon) as a mini project and a regular Notepad I use!
