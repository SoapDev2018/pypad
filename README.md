This is a demo Notepad type application I tried to develop while I was learning Tkinter. It has options like New File, Open File, Save File and Exit. Other options include Cut, Copy, Paste. Original concept by Mrinal Verma for GeeksForGeeks.org, modified by me, Sayantan Chaudhuri as a mini project and a regular Notepad I use!
